 <p>

 Amid the relentless storm of snow, a man in his early twenties could be seen, dragged through the white abyss by a strikingly beautiful woman who seemed to be around the same age.

  <Br>
  <Br>

 His body was in shambles—tattered clothing clinging to him, deep wounds and jagged cuts still leaking trails of blood onto the frozen ground.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 In that pitiful state, the young man’s lips moved.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “Seol-ah…”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 The woman, upon hearing her name, did not answer. She pressed forward, ignoring his voice, dragging him away.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 His voice came again, firmer, harsher this time.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “Seol-ah.”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 She halted. Silence fell for a heartbeat before she spoke, her tone trembling with desperation.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “Shut up.”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “…,” he stayed quiet, unsettled. Why did she sound like that?

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “Don’t talk,” Seol-ah continued, her words faltering. “I will… You will be fine, so stop talking. Don’t talk, I beg you.”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 The young man sighed inwardly. He was exhausted.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 I’m tired… How did my life come to this? I’ve lived through so much… seen so much. I’ve enjoyed things. I’ve lost things—lost people. And I’m tired. So tired…

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 No… it’s more like I burned everything inside me just to keep moving forward in this life. But… was it worth it?

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 His gaze shifted to the desperate, tear-streaked mess that was Seol-ah, and he found his answer.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 Of course it was worth it… I’d do it all again if I had to.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 Her footing slipped, and both she and his ruined body tumbled into the thick snow.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 The only warmth Seol-ah could feel was the hot, fresh blood seeping from him… though even that turned cold within seconds.

  <Br>
  <Br>
   
 Her sobs grew louder. She didn’t want him to die—not here, not now. She wanted to drag him to safety, to someone who could treat him. But deep down, she knew the truth: his body was beyond saving. It was a miracle he was still alive at all.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 She pressed her face into his chest, crying her heart out.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “…” Ryu’s heart ached at the sight of her like this.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 She shouldn’t be crying for someone like me… I had it coming sooner or later.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 With the last of his strength, he lifted his broken arms and pulled her into his embrace.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “I’m sorry…”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “You’re a fool,” she choked out between sobs. “Please don’t die, Ryu… Just don’t. Please.”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 His vision was fading now, the world blurring. His soul felt like it was slipping away.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 I’m exhausted… With this, I can finally rest—no. I’ll probably end up in hell, after all I’ve done. He let out a faint chuckle in his mind. Was he really the fool Seol-ah claimed him to be? Perhaps.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 And with that… Ryu died.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 …

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 …

  <Br>
  <Br>

 …

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 Huh?

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 A strange sensation pressed against his back. It wasn’t snow. It wasn’t cold. It felt more like… dirt.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 Didn’t I die? Is this hell? Hmm… I thought hell would be a little more… spicy, maybe?

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 He opened his eyes.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 What he saw left him bewildered—countless people stretched out before him, all wearing the same shocked expressions.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 He looked down at himself. No wounds. Not a single cut. The blood was still smeared across his body, but there was no source—no open injury.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 What is this…? I could’ve sworn I was about to die…

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 And then he noticed the place itself. Vast. Boundless. Mountains on the horizon, but not a single plant in sight—only dirt and rock as far as he could see.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 “The fuck…”

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 It was then that he saw it—a strange light, striking people at random. Passing over some, engulfing others.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 Somehow, he knew it was coming for him.

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 Ah… just let me rest already…

  <Br>
  <Br>
  
 The light hit him.

  <Br>
